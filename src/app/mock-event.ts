        description: "It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children, While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.",

        name: "Les Miserables",
        description: "Les Miserables is a musical by Claude-Michel Schenberg which is based on Victor Hugo’s humungous historical novel of 1862 that covers the twists, turns and tales of French Revolution. Despite its inherent theme of adversity and misfortune along with the weight of the title, Les Mis is not all misery and no-joy-show rather it beautifully brings to stage the profound realities of our deep dark history. Set in early 19th-century France in the air of rebel and revolt, the musical is a strong and smart depiction of the transition of a society going through the several stringent stages of revolution.",

        description: "STOMP is the event that unites dance, comedy and music into a theatrical whirlwind you’ll never forget. Creators and co-directors Luke Cresswell and Steve McNicholas have created a theatrical experience like no other – playful, thrilling and exploding with energy. STOMP has hammered out a universal theatrical language of rhythm, movement, comedy and dance, bringing everyday objects like Zippo lighters, plastic bags, bin lids – even the kitchen sink – to life along the way. It’s the event that showed the globe that even the most ordinary objects can do extraordinary things – in the right hands.STOMP takes the familiar – newspapers, bins – and uses them to create a rhythmic universe exploding with energy, where anything can be turned into a beat, and anybody can pound a pattern! From its humble beginnings in Brighton, with a single drum hung around Luke Creswell’s neck in 1991, STOMP has grown into a phenomenon that has the world dancing to its beat. It’ll set your toes tapping and your pulse racing.",
